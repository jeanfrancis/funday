Funday Monday
=============

Funday Monday is something that `Day[9] <http://day9.tv/>`_ invented a few years
ago. The idea is to play StarCraft 2 with some interesting constraint. Day[9]
would then ask his viewers to send in replays of themselves playing with those
constraints. After picking the most interesting and funnest he would broadcast
them on his stream both pointing out the hilarity as well as things we can learn
from what has manifested while the player was constrained.
